# multithread-task
Basic custom implementation of wrappers of concurrency primitives based on POSIX threads.<br>
Inspired by C++ standard library.
### Currently implemented concurrency primitives:
* condition_variable
* mutex (recursive_mutex), helper classes (lock_guard, unique_lock)
* thread/jthread
